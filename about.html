            I'm Barry Pitman, and this is my software development blog! I've been working as a software developer at
            <a href="ww.ubiquitech.co.za">Ubiquitech</a> since 2010. I mostly work on Java web applications, but also
            double up as a DBA, sysadmin, and front-end developer (jack of all trades - master of none!).

            I'm living in Brussels, Belgium with my wife, though I count myself as a South African.
