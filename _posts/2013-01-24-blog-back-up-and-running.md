It's been quite a while since I wrote anything here; my old domain name expired almost a year ago, and I figured
I might as well give GitHub Pages a try.

I've finished migrating my old posts (all 3 of them) from WordPress to GitHub - what a pleasure!
There are plenty of guides for setting up GitHub-hosted blogs, using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and/or [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), so I won't get into that, but I was really impressed
with how quick and simple it was! I'm hoping that having it hosted in a
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/barrypitman/barrypitman.github.com/) and publishing via push will make
it quicker and easier to jot things down as posts.

I'm also considering moving our company's corporate website from Joomla to GitHub - if its static content, then its
just going to be easier to manage via a GitHub repo.

In addition, I get some much needed practice writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and
working with Ruby. So far, so good!

I have a bunch of things that I've been meaning to document here for a while, so stay tuned...
